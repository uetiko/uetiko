# Welcome (´･ᴗ･ ` )

I'm **Angel Barrientos**, a software architect and technical lead with over fifteen years building resilient systems for e-commerce, fintech, and electronic invoicing platforms across Latin America.

I bridge code, infrastructure, and people—translating complex business needs into architectures that scale and endure. My work blends pragmatism with ethics: clean code, clear communication, and consistent delivery.
